 Due to the fact that I am able to use a helicpter view. I don't just think outside the box, but take the box to a whole other level.

I am not bound by one specialism or discipline, and am very strong in analysing on a broader level.

**Let me be sure to tell you, that everything in this blog, is my point of view. It is not the absolute truth. Because that is only in the eyes of the beholder.** 

I am honoured and truly humbled to have the opportunity to share my opinion with you.
